Find version number
  3) To find out the version of your project, go to your project page and click on the version section. For example, it is written as balloon_finder/1. Here the number after the / sign represents the project version.

Model id
  4) Your model id is a combination of project name and project version. So for example it is written as " balloon_finder/1 " .

Api Url
  5) To access the api url, it will be enough to copy the web address (url) of your roboflow workspace.
