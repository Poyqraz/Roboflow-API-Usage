# Roboflow-API-Using

First of all, how to get api url?

  1) You can find your customized api key in the roboflow api tab by clicking the settings button in the upper right corner of your workspace page.

Project Name

  2) To access your project name, you need to copy the name of your project under the projects heading in your workspace.

Find version number

  3) To find out the version of your project, go to your project page and click on the version section. For example, it is written as balloon_finder/1. Here the number after the / sign represents the project version.

Model id

  4) Your model id is a combination of project name and project version. So for example it is written as " balloon_finder/1 " .

Api Url

  5) To access the api url, it will be enough to copy the web address (url) of your roboflow workspace.

I shared the python file required for API usage in the article content.
